# Agricultural Data Analysis & Visualization in R
In this workshop, we'll be using agricultural data to learn R. There are two parts:
- **Working With Data**: For complete beginners - a walkthrough of RStudio, setting up our environment, and learning foundational functions 
- **Exploring & Visualizing Data:** For the adventurous beginner - walks through visualization in R (specifically `ggplot2`) + agg specific visuals

Slides are available here

Recording will be available after the workshop.
